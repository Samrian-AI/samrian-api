What is this project about? Check every directory and explain its purpose. Detail each and every RAG-related functionality and how it works. How can I extract the RAG components from this project and use them in other projects? I'm specifically interested in the RAG pipelines, without any other complexities like databases, APIs, or local models—just a barebone RAG.

How exactly do I do this? Provide technical guides with all the context from the current app's structure. Then, analyze it and, because it's sophisticated and very good RAG, extract its best practices and excellent logic. Next, analyze how I can extract and recreate/reuse this RAG logic as a whole—the entire app's RAG logic—because it's sophisticated and good, similar to:

* Visual-first Retrieval
* Knowledge Graphs
* Visual-first Retrieval
* Diagram Intelligence

Morphik directly embeds each page from your input into its store, meaning no context is lost due to imperfect parsing or processing techniques. See results like "Morphik with 4o-mini beat gpt-o3."

Guide me in very technical detail how these RAG techniques are applied and used in Morphik, and how can I reuse them and extract them out.

### Technical Deep Dive into Morphik's RAG Techniques and Reusability

To provide a very technical guide on extracting and reusing Morphik's RAG logic, we need to understand the underlying principles of each highlighted technique and how they typically translate into a RAG architecture. Morphik focuses on handling visually rich and multimodal documents, which implies a sophisticated approach beyond simple text-based RAG.

#### 1. Understanding the Core RAG Process (General)

Before diving into Morphik's specifics, let's briefly recall the general RAG pipeline, as Morphik builds upon this foundation:

1.  **Ingestion:**
    * **Data Acquisition:** Gathering documents (PDFs, images, diagrams, text files).
    * **Chunking:** Breaking down large documents into smaller, semantically meaningful units. For multimodal RAG, this might involve intelligent chunking that respects visual layouts, tables, and diagrams, not just text.
    * **Embedding:** Converting these chunks into numerical vector representations (embeddings) using an embedding model. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the chunks.
    * **Indexing:** Storing these embeddings in a vector database for efficient similarity search. Metadata extraction (e.g., bounding boxes, labels, document type) is crucial here.

2.  **Retrieval:**
    * **Query Embedding:** The user's natural language query is also converted into an embedding.
    * **Similarity Search:** The query embedding is used to search the vector database for the most semantically similar document chunks. This often involves Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms (e.g., HNSW).
    * **Re-ranking (Optional but common):** A re-ranking model might be used to further refine the retrieved chunks, ensuring higher relevance. This is especially important in multimodal contexts to prioritize chunks that are visually or structurally relevant.

3.  **Augmentation:**
    * The retrieved, relevant chunks (and their associated metadata, including visual context) are combined with the original user query to create an augmented prompt for the Large Language Model (LLM).

4.  **Generation:**
    * The LLM receives the augmented prompt and generates a response based on its internal knowledge and the provided context.

#### 2. Morphik's Advanced RAG Techniques and Their Technical Implementation

Morphik explicitly mentions "Visual-first Retrieval," "Knowledge Graphs," and "Diagram Intelligence," and the concept of directly embedding each page. This suggests a strong emphasis on multimodal RAG and structured knowledge.

**2.1. Visual-first Retrieval and Diagram Intelligence**

This is where Morphik truly differentiates itself. Traditional RAG often struggles with non-textual information. Morphik's approach implies:

* **Multimodal Embedding Models:** Instead of just text embedding models, Morphik likely employs Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like PaliGemma or JinaCLIP (as seen in similar projects like VARAG). These models are trained to understand both visual and textual information and can embed entire document pages (including images, diagrams, and layout) into a shared vector space. This is critical for "directly embedding each page... meaning no context is lost to imperfect parsing."
    * **Technical Detail:** This involves feeding the VLM the image of a document page (or a region containing a diagram/table) and potentially any extracted text from it. The VLM outputs a dense vector representation that captures the combined visual and textual semantics. This vector is then indexed in the vector database.
    * **Chunking Strategy:** Instead of purely text-based chunking, Morphik's chunking strategy likely considers the visual layout. It might identify diagrams, tables, and text blocks as distinct chunks, potentially using bounding box information to define these regions. This aligns with "Diagram Intelligence" – the ability to not just OCR text, but understand the *relationships* and *meaning* within a diagram. This might involve:
        * **Layout Analysis:** Using models to detect and classify different document elements (text, images, tables, diagrams, headers, footers).
        * **OCR with Spatial Information:** Extracting text from images and preserving its precise location (bounding boxes).
        * **Graph Representation of Visuals (Diagram Intelligence):** For diagrams, this could go beyond simple image embedding. It might involve:
            * **Object Detection:** Identifying components (e.g., shapes, arrows, labels) within diagrams.
            * **Relationship Extraction:** Inferring connections between these components (e.g., an arrow pointing from A to B implies flow or dependency).
            * **Conversion to Structured Data:** Representing the diagram's logic as a small, local knowledge graph or a structured JSON object. This structured representation, along with the visual embedding, would then be indexed.
    * **Retrieval Process:** When a query comes in (e.g., "What's the third pin on the USBC21 diagram?"), it's embedded by the VLM. The similarity search then not only finds textually relevant pages but also visually relevant ones. If diagram intelligence creates structured data, the retrieval might also perform graph traversal or structured queries on this extracted data.
    * **Augmentation:** The prompt to the LLM would include descriptions of the relevant visual elements, potentially the extracted structured data from diagrams, and the embedded page image itself if the LLM is multimodal (like GPT-4o).

**2.2. Knowledge Graphs**

Morphik also mentions Knowledge Graphs. This indicates a more structured approach to representing relationships within the ingested data, complementing vector search.

* **Technical Detail:**
    * **Entity and Relationship Extraction:** During ingestion, an LLM or dedicated NLP models are used to identify entities (e.g., "John," "Director," "Digital Marketing Group") and the relationships between them (e.g., "John *is* Director *of* Digital Marketing Group"). This can be done from both text and potentially from the structured output of diagram intelligence.
    * **Graph Database:** These extracted entities and relationships are stored in a graph database (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune). Nodes represent entities, and edges represent relationships.
    * **Graph Traversal for Retrieval:** When a query involves complex relationships (e.g., "Who works with Jane and what is Sharon's title?"), the RAG system can first query the knowledge graph to retrieve interconnected facts. This allows for multi-hop reasoning that purely semantic vector search might miss.
    * **Combining with Vector Search (Hybrid Retrieval):** Knowledge graph queries can provide highly precise, factual context, while vector search handles broader semantic understanding and less structured information. The results from both can be combined before augmentation.
    * **Node Importance (PageRank):** Morphik's use of PageRank for node importance in graphs means that during retrieval or re-ranking, facts/entities with higher importance scores (indicating their centrality or relevance within the knowledge graph) can be prioritized.

**2.3. Direct Page Embedding**

"Morphik directly embeds each page in your input into its store, meaning no context is lost to imperfect parsing or processing techniques."

* **Technical Detail:** This reinforces the use of multimodal embedding models (VLMs) that can process an entire page as an image. Instead of relying solely on OCR output (which can be imperfect for complex layouts), the raw image of the page is directly embedded. This allows the retrieval to be robust even if text extraction fails or misinterprets visual cues.
* **Benefits:** This mitigates issues like:
    * **OCR Errors:** When text extraction is flawed, the VLM can still understand the visual context.
    * **Layout Preservation:** The spatial relationships of text, images, and diagrams are inherently captured in the page embedding.
    * **Context Loss:** Ensures that the "big picture" of a page, including its visual flow, is maintained.

#### 3. How to Extract and Reuse Morphik's RAG Logic (Barebone RAG)

Extracting a "barebone RAG" from a sophisticated system like Morphik means identifying the core components that enable its advanced capabilities, while shedding unnecessary complexity like UI, full API layers, or specific database instances.

The goal is to replicate the *logic* of the RAG pipeline, particularly the innovative ingestion and retrieval steps.

**Conceptual Extraction Plan:**

1.  **Identify Core Data Structures:**
    * **Document Chunks/Pages:** How are the original documents broken down? For Morphik, this isn't just text. It includes the original image of the page, bounding box information for elements, and potentially structured data from diagrams/tables.
    * **Embeddings:** The numerical vectors representing these chunks/pages.
    * **Knowledge Graph Triples (if applicable):** (Subject, Predicate, Object) tuples if you're specifically extracting the graph logic.

2.  **Identify Key Models:**
    * **Multimodal Embedding Model (VLM):** This is paramount for "Visual-first Retrieval." You'll need to identify which VLM Morphik uses or a suitable open-source alternative (e.g., from Hugging Face, such as various CLIP or LLaVA models, or Google's PaliGemma if accessible).
    * **Text Embedding Model:** For pure text chunks (if any are still generated alongside visual embeddings).
    * **LLM for Entity/Relationship Extraction (if extracting KG logic):** If the knowledge graph is built dynamically from documents, you'll need the LLM or NLP pipeline that performs this.
    * **Re-ranking Model (if used):** A cross-encoder model that takes a query and a retrieved chunk/document and outputs a relevance score.

3.  **Identify Core Algorithms/Pipelines:**
    * **Intelligent Chunking Logic:** How does Morphik determine chunk boundaries, especially considering visuals? This involves understanding their layout analysis and how it segments documents into visual and textual components.
    * **Embedding Generation Pipeline:** The code that takes raw documents/pages, applies the VLM, and generates embeddings.
    * **Vector Search Logic:** The similarity search algorithm (e.g., cosine similarity) combined with an ANN index.
    * **Knowledge Graph Construction (if extracting KG logic):** The pipeline that converts unstructured/semi-structured content into graph triples.
    * **Knowledge Graph Querying (if extracting KG logic):** The logic for traversing the graph to retrieve relevant facts based on a query.
    * **Prompt Augmentation Strategy:** How retrieved visual context, text chunks, and KG facts are combined into a final prompt for the generative LLM.

**Technical Steps for Extraction and Reuse:**

Given that Morphik is an open-source RAG stack (Morphik Core is on GitHub), the most direct way to understand and extract is to **analyze their codebase.**

**A. Ingestion Pipeline Extraction:**

1.  **Document Parsing & Layout Analysis:**
    * **Goal:** Replicate how Morphik identifies text blocks, images, diagrams, and tables, and their spatial relationships on a page.
    * **Morphik's Approach (Likely):** Morphik mentions "directly embeds each page" and its capabilities with "Diagram Intelligence." This suggests a robust internal document processing engine. Look for modules handling:
        * **Image Processing Libraries:** (e.g., Pillow, OpenCV) for loading and manipulating document images.
        * **OCR Integration:** (e.g., Tesseract, Google Cloud Vision, Azure Document Intelligence) to extract text, but critically, also its bounding box coordinates.
        * **Layout Parsers:** Libraries or custom code that takes OCR output and spatial information to group text into paragraphs, identify table structures, and recognize diagrams. This might involve rule-based systems, machine learning models trained on document layouts, or even visual parsing (e.g., detecting lines, shapes).
    * **Extraction/Reusability:**
        * **Identify the specific functions/classes** responsible for loading a PDF/image, performing layout analysis, and extracting structured information (text, image regions, table data, diagram data with bounding boxes).
        * **Abstract this into a `DocumentProcessor` class/module.** This class would take a document path and return a list of "document parts" (e.g., `{'type': 'text', 'content': '...', 'bbox': [...]}`, `{'type': 'image', 'path': '...', 'bbox': [...]}`, `{'type': 'table', 'data': [...], 'bbox': [...]}`).

2.  **Multimodal Embedding Generation:**
    * **Goal:** Generate high-quality embeddings that capture both visual and textual information for each processed document part or the entire page.
    * **Morphik's Approach (Likely):** Use of VLMs (Vision-Language Models).
    * **Extraction/Reusability:**
        * **Identify the VLM integration:** Find where Morphik loads and uses its chosen VLM. This could be a `transformers` library integration, a custom API call, or a local model inference.
        * **Create an `EmbeddingGenerator` class:** This class would encapsulate the VLM. It should have a method like `generate_embedding(document_part, type='text'|'image'|'page_image')`. For an entire page, it would take the page image. For a specific diagram, it might take a cropped image of the diagram.
        * **Dependencies:** Note down the exact VLM model used and its associated libraries (e.g., `transformers`, `torch`/`tensorflow`).

3.  **Knowledge Graph Construction (if applicable):**
    * **Goal:** Convert extracted facts and relationships into a graph structure.
    * **Morphik's Approach (Likely):** LLM-based entity/relationship extraction combined with graph database storage.
    * **Extraction/Reusability:**
        * **Identify NLP/LLM for Extraction:** Find the code that takes parsed text or structured diagram data and identifies entities and relationships. This might involve prompt engineering if using an LLM, or named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) models.
        * **Define Graph Schema:** Understand the types of nodes (e.g., `Person`, `Concept`, `DiagramElement`) and relationships (e.g., `WORKS_WITH`, `POINTS_TO`, `HAS_PROPERTY`) Morphik uses.
        * **Create a `GraphBuilder` class:** This class would take the output from the `DocumentProcessor` and use the extraction logic to create graph triples. Instead of writing to a database, it could return a list of these triples `(subject, predicate, object)`.
        * **Dependencies:** NLP libraries (SpaCy, NLTK, or `transformers` for LLM inference).

**B. Retrieval Pipeline Extraction:**

1.  **Vector Store (Conceptual):**
    * **Goal:** Efficiently store and search embeddings.
    * **Morphik's Approach (Likely):** Uses an underlying vector database.
    * **Extraction/Reusability:** You don't need the *entire* database. You need the *logic* of indexing and querying.
        * **Create a `VectorIndex` class:** This class would have methods like `add_embedding(embedding, metadata)` and `search(query_embedding, k=N)`.
        * **Choose a local/in-memory vector library:** For a barebones RAG, use libraries like `faiss-cpu`, `hnswlib`, or even a simple `numpy` based cosine similarity search for small datasets. This avoids external database dependencies.
        * **Metadata Handling:** Ensure the `VectorIndex` can store and retrieve metadata alongside embeddings (e.g., original text, bounding box, source document, `is_diagram` flag).

2.  **Query Processing:**
    * **Goal:** Convert a user query into an embedding.
    * **Morphik's Approach:** Same VLM or a dedicated text embedding model.
    * **Extraction/Reusability:** Reuse the `EmbeddingGenerator` from the ingestion phase to embed the user query.

3.  **Hybrid Retrieval Logic (if applicable):**
    * **Goal:** Combine vector search results with knowledge graph queries.
    * **Morphik's Approach (Likely):** Perform vector search for semantic relevance and knowledge graph traversal for factual/relational context.
    * **Extraction/Reusability:**
        * **Define a `Retriever` class:** This class would orchestrate the search.
        * **Vector Search Component:** Call the `VectorIndex.search()` method.
        * **Knowledge Graph Query Component (if extracting KG logic):** If you built a local graph representation (e.g., using `networkx`), this component would query it. It would parse the user query to identify entities that can be looked up in the graph.
        * **Result Merging/Re-ranking:** Implement logic to combine results from vector search and knowledge graph queries. This might involve:
            * **Score Aggregation:** Combining similarity scores with graph-based relevance scores (e.g., shortest path length, PageRank of relevant nodes).
            * **Contextual Filtering:** Using metadata from vector search (e.g., `is_diagram`) to prioritize certain types of content if the query implies it (e.g., "explain this diagram").
            * **Cross-Encoder Re-ranking:** If Morphik uses a re-ranker, integrate that model here. It takes pairs of (query, retrieved_chunk) and gives a more precise relevance score.

**C. Augmentation and Generation (LLM Integration):**

1.  **Prompt Engineering Strategy:**
    * **Goal:** Construct an effective prompt for the LLM.
    * **Morphik's Approach:** Combines retrieved text, structured data from diagrams, and potentially descriptions of visual elements.
    * **Extraction/Reusability:**
        * **Create a `PromptBuilder` class:** This class takes the user query and the retrieved context (text chunks, diagram data, KG facts, even paths to relevant images if the LLM supports multimodal input).
        * **Context Formatting:** Determine how Morphik formats the retrieved information within the prompt (e.g., "Here is some relevant text: [...], Here is a diagram description: [...], Here are some facts: [...]").
        * **Instruction Tuning:** Note the instructions given to the LLM (e.g., "Answer the question using ONLY the provided context," "Explain the diagram shown in the image").

2.  **LLM Integration (Placeholder):**
    * **Goal:** Send the augmented prompt to an LLM.
    * **Barebone Approach:** You would integrate with a local LLM (e.g., Llama.cpp, Ollama) or an API-based LLM (OpenAI, Gemini). Morphik states it supports "all LLMs and Embedding Models."
    * **Extraction/Reusability:** This is typically the easiest part to make "barebone." You'll just need a function that takes a prompt string and returns the LLM's response.

**D. Directory Structure Analysis (Hypothetical for a well-structured RAG project):**

When you examine Morphik's codebase, look for directories and files related to:

* `data_ingestion/` or `document_processing/`: Contains logic for loading, parsing (PDF, images), OCR, layout analysis, chunking, and metadata extraction.
* `models/` or `embeddings/`: Contains definitions, loading mechanisms, and inference code for embedding models (VLMs, text embeddings) and potentially re-ranking models.
* `vector_store/` or `index/`: Contains code for interacting with the vector database (embedding storage, similarity search algorithms, index creation). For a barebone version, this might be a local FAISS index or HNSWlib.
* `knowledge_graph/`: Contains logic for entity/relationship extraction, graph schema definition, and interaction with a graph database (or an in-memory graph library like `networkx`).
* `retrieval/`: Orchestrates the query processing, vector search, knowledge graph queries, and result merging/re-ranking.
* `llm_integration/` or `generation/`: Handles prompt augmentation and interaction with the LLM.
* `utils/`: Common utilities, helper functions.
* `config/`: Configuration files for models, chunking strategies, database connections.
* `scripts/`: Scripts for data ingestion, model training/fine-tuning (if applicable), and running the RAG pipeline.

By systematically going through these conceptual components and mapping them to Morphik's actual code, you can isolate the core RAG logic. The "very good and excellent RAG best practice and logic" lies in how Morphik intelligently handles multimodal data, leverages knowledge graphs, and performs sophisticated retrieval before augmentation. Reusing it involves re-implementing or directly using these specific modules and algorithms in your own simplified environment.
